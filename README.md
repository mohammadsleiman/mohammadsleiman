# Hi I'm Mohammad üëã

## About
### Software developer & recent college grad, passionate about building products that have a positive societal impact

I'm a software developer who has recently graduated from San Jose State University (B.S. Computer Science) '22 looking for a software engineer role. Ever since I was a kid, I have been extremely passionate about technology and how it could be used to solve the problems around me. Motivated by this goal, in college, I worked on a few projects/startups: Haven and Netvyne. Through my experiences, I have become further interested in applying my skillset at a larger scale, so I interned at SAP and UKG, where I worked on building end-to-end full-stack web applications. I am looking to pursue a career as a software engineer at a company where I can build and contribute to products which have long-lasting positive societal impact

Currently living in San Jose üèôÔ∏è

## My Past Work
- [**UKG**](https://www.ukg.com/), where I interned in the fall of 2021 for 15 weeks as a member of the Recruitment team, responsible for the public facing job listings features of the UKG PRO Product. I built features across the stack directly on their cloud-based product, using React, .Net, & MongoDB

- [**SAP**](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html), where I interned in the summer of 2021 for 14 weeks as a member of the Payroll team within SAP SuccessFactors, responsible for handling global payroll as part of their cloud-based HR Product offering. I built an administrative web application used internally at SAP to manage data across their development and testing environments and automate data uploading. My application was built using React & Node JS, supports all 41 payroll regions, integrates with 10+ services within SAP's Cloud Software, speeds up engineer's workflow from 30 to 2 minutes, and is used today by over 100 engineers, managers, & product designers across various teams at SAP.

- [**Haven**](https://github.com/mohammadsleiman/Haven), a full-stack web project to connect cyclists with great businesses and places across their city. Logged-in users can search, review & rate local places. Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Google Places & Auth API, MongoDb Atlas, and AWS. 

- [**Netvyne**](https://www.netvyne.com/), a startup I co-founded to bring a comment section to every url on the internet. Built using HTML/CSS/JS, Flask, and PostgreSQL, this chrome extension injects a feature-rich, moderated comment section right into the HTML of every webpage. Through the main web application, users can add friends, share content & thoughts, and discover content through a feed.

- [**Foodify**](https://github.com/mohammadsleiman/Foodify.us), a web platform I developed and presented in a team of 4 as part of my Engineering College Thesis Project. Foodify is a web platform that connects home culinary enthusiasts with recipes tailored to their needs. My role included the complete setup and design of the backend server, API's, and database, as well as implementing the Search and Home Feed Related Pages. I was also the main UX Designer for all the pages across the web platform, for which I utilized Figma. We built this using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Google Auth, Google FireBase, and MongoDB Atlas. As part of this project we had regular team check-ins, weekly advisor meetings, and montly status reports.

- [**SCE**](https://sce.engr.sjsu.edu/), a San Jose State University Club associated with the College of Engineering where I served as a software development team officer. My role included designing new Data Objects and revamping API's across the 10,000 line codebase to support them. I mainly worked with Node JS. It is currently used by over 300+ organization members.
