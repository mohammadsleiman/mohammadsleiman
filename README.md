### Hi I'm Mohammad ðŸ‘‹

## About
I'm a software developer who has recently graduated from San Jose State University (B.S. Software Engineering/ Computer Science) '22

## My Past Work
- [**UKG**](https://www.ukg.com/), where I interned in the fall of 2021 for 15 weeks as a member of the Recruitment team, responsible for the public facing job listings features of the UKG PRO Product. I built features across the stack directly on their cloud-based product, using React, .Net, & MongoDB

- [**SAP**](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html), where I interned in the summer of 2021 for 14 weeks as a member of the Payroll team within SAP SuccessFactors, responsible for handling global payroll as part of their cloud-based HR Product offering. I built an administrative web application used internally at SAP to manage data across their development and testing environments and automate data uploading. My application was built using React & Node JS, supports all 41 payroll regions, integrates with 10+ services within SAP's Cloud Software, speeds up engineer's workflow from 30 to 2 minutes, and is used today by over 100 engineers, managers, & product designers across various teams at SAP.

- [**Haven**](https://github.com/mohammadsleiman/Haven), a project I worked on to connect cyclists with great businesses and places across their city. Users can search, review & rate local places. Built using the MERN Stack, Google Places & Auth, MongoDb Atlas, and AWS.

- [**Netvyne**](https://www.netvyne.com/), a startup I co-founded to bring a comment section to every url on the internet. Built using HTML/CSS/JS, Flask, and PostgreSQL, this chrome extension injects a feature-rich, moderated comment section right into the HTML of every webpage. Through the main web application, users can add friends, share content & thoughts, and discover content through a feed.

- [**Foodify**](https://github.com/mohammadsleiman/Foodify.us), a web platform I designed in a team of 4 as part of my Engineering College Thesis Project. Foodify is a web platform that connects home culinary enthusiasts with recipes tailored to their needs. My role included the complete setup and design of the backend server, API's, and database. I was also responsible for designing and implementing the Search Bar, Search Result, Home Feed Pages. I was also the main UX Designer for all the pages across the web platform, which my teammates referenced to build their respective web pages. We built this using the MERN Stack, Google Auth, Google FireBase, and MongoDB Atlas

- [**SCE**](https://sce.engr.sjsu.edu/), a San Jose State University club where I served as a software development team officer. My role included designing new Data Objects and revamping API's across the 10,000 line codebase to support them. I mainly worked with Node JS. It is currently used by over 300+ organization members.
