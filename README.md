### Hi I'm Mohammad 👋

## About
I'm a software developer who has recently graduated from San Jose State University (B.S. Software Engineering/ Computer Science) '22

## My Past Work
- [**UKG**](https://www.ukg.com/), where I interned in the fall of 2021 for 15 weeks as a member of the Recruitment team, responsible for the public facing job listings features of the UKG PRO Product. I built features across the stack directly on their cloud-based product, using React, .Net, & MongoDB

- [**SAP**](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html), where I interned in the summer of 2021 for 14 weeks as a member of the Payroll team within SAP SuccessFactors, responsible for handling global payroll as part of their cloud-based HR Product offering. I built an administrative web application used internally at SAP to manage data across their development and testing environments and automate data uploading. My application was built using React & Node JS, supports all 41 payroll regions, integrates with 10+ services within SAP's Cloud Software, speeds up engineer's workflow from 30 to 2 minutes, and is used today by over 100 engineers, managers, & product designers across various teams at SAP.

- [**Haven**](https://github.com/mohammadsleiman/Haven), a project I worked on to connect cyclists with great businesses and places across their city. Users can search, review & rate local places. Built using the MERN Stack, Google Places & Auth, and AWS.

- [**Netvyne**](https://www.netvyne.com/), a startup I co-founded to bring a comment section to every url on the internet. Built using HTML/CSS/JS, Flask, and PostgreSQL, this chrome extension injects a feature-rich, moderated comment section right into the HTML of every webpage. Through the main web application, users can add friends, share content & thoughts, and discover content through a feed.

- [**SCE**](https://sce.engr.sjsu.edu/), a San Jose State University club where I served as a software development team officer. My role included designing new Data Objects and revamping API's across the 10,000 line codebase to support them. I mainly worked with Node JS. It is currently used by over 300+ organization members.
