I built an administrative web application used internally at SAP to manage data across their development and testing environments and automate data uploading. My application was built using React & Node JS, supports all 41 payroll regions, integrates with 10+ services within SAP's Cloud Software, speeds up engineer's workflow from 30 to 2 minutes, and is used today by over 100 engineers, managers, & product designers across various teams at SAP.

I was also the main UX Designer for all the pages across the web platform, for which I utilized Figma.
